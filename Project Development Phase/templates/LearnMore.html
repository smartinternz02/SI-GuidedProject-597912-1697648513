            <p id = "Paragraph1" class="Paragraph">This web application utilizes Deep Learning techniques to classify Images based on the type of crime. A pre-trained model called Resnet50 is trained on a custom dataset to achieve the task</p>
            <br>
            <p id="Paragraph2" class="Paragraph"><a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/architecture-of-densenet121/" id="DenseNetInfo" target="_blank">ResNet50</a> is a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture used for image classification and feature extraction in deep learning. It is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture, which was introduced by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun in their 2015 paper titled "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition."</p>

            <p id="Paragraph3" class="Paragraph">ResNet-50 is specifically known for its depth, featuring 50 layers of convolutional and fully connected layers. The key innovation in ResNet is the use of residual connections, also known as skip connections or shortcut connections. These connections allow the network to learn residual functions, making it easier to train very deep networks without encountering the vanishing gradient problem.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="Paragraph4" class="Paragraph">The ResNet-50 model consists of several building blocks, each of which includes multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions. Residual connections skip one or more of these blocks, allowing the model to directly learn the difference (residual) between the input and the output of the block.</p>
